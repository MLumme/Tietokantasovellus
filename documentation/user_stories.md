## User stories
  * As a user, I can register an account for myself and log on.
  * As a user, I can view all available threads on the forums main page.
  * As a registered user, I can select a thread and view responses to it by clicking on the link in its title in the main page.
  * As an admin user, I can in addition of the above remove threads from their removal-buttons.
  * As a registered user, I can add a new thread and first post from the "Add a new thread"-button, and additionally select multiple or none thread subjects.
  * As a registered user, I can respond to a thread from it's "New post"-button.
  * As an admin user, I can edit or remove messages from the corresponding buttons on each post, by any other user.
  * As a registered user, I can edit my own posts.
  * As a registered user I can search for string, either in thread titles, message contents, and userenames, getting a list of resulting threads in the first case, messages in the second case, and both in the last case, filtered with thread subjects.  
  * As a user, I can change my username and password from User-link, and view my post statistics, and remove my account.
  * As an admin, I can view information and posting statistics about all the other users on the forum from Admin-link, and add subjects for users to use when creating threads or searching. It also provides links to different users pages which gives me the possibilty to change users names and passwords (although this would require knowing users old password, so not that useful), and buttons to directly remove users, and promote them to admin-status, unless they are admins already.
